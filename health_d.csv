You probably already know to limit air pollution exposure when possible but have you heard about the relationship between air quality and long-term health? Health Condition Likelihood Rises Due To Air Pollution A 2022 study of adults in England showed that long-term exposure to air pollution from traffic made people more likely to have multiple long-term mental and physical health conditions. Scientists already know people with numerous health conditions spend more on care and seek medical advice more often. However this was the first study in the United Kingdom that connected multiple long-term conditions with air pollution. Researchers collected genetic lifestyle and health information from more than 500000 participants aged 40 to 69. They then analyzed the prevalence of 36 physical and five mental health chronic conditions. The results showed people exposed to high levels of fine particulate matter from automobiles had a 21% higher chance of having two or more health conditions at the same time than those living with lower concentrations of air pollution. The examination of high levels of exposure to nitrogen dioxide was similar with people being 20% more likely to have at least two chronic health conditions simultaneously. Possible Connection Found Between Pollution And Skin Health Being in low-humidity environments can dry the skin which is made of 64% water and is the body s largest organ. Some people with chronic skin conditions find that dry air worsens them too. As it turns out that s not the only air-related issue that can affect the skin. A 2023 study analyzed how air pollution from Canadian wildfires affected people living in Boston Massachusetts. One takeaway was a spike in dermatology appointments associated with atopic dermatitis and eczema. Those involved with the study said such conditions usually worsen in winter due to air dryness. However their investigation occurred during a summer of severe wildfires. When the researchers compared dermatologist visit data from the summer of high wildfire activity with the previous four years they believed high levels of carbon monoxide could have caused the uptick in skin problems. The team clarified that chronic air pollution exposure can cause cumulative damage to the skin by triggering a stress response that can lead to premature aging increased skin damage and more inflammation. Links Between Air Pollution And Cardiovascular Health People rightfully paid a lot of attention to deaths caused by COVID-19. Something that often gets overlooked however is that air pollution kills more people than that virus. When the American Heart Association published a research article that examined 30 years of data they found a 31% worldwide increase in premature deaths and disabilities from cardiovascular disease linked to particulate matter air pollution. There were gender-related differences to study too. More specifically there was a 43% increase in such deaths among men and a 28.2% increase in females. Another finding was that a person s socioeconomic status affected cardiovascular disease s impact on their lives. When someone lived in a region with high socioeconomic conditions they were less likely to die from cardiovascular disease and lived more years disabled by it. However the opposite was true for people living in places with comparatively worse socioeconomic conditions. Protecting Yourself From Air Pollution Almost everyone occasionally experiences air pollution and it s a daily occurrence for some people. Given what researchers have discovered about its adverse effects on health what can you do to increase your chances of staying healthy for as long as possible even if you can t wholly avoid dirty air? One practical step is to become familiar with your area s air quality index. It s a 500-point scale that indicates air pollution levels. If the daily level is 101 or higher consider limiting your time outside to less than a half-hour. Then if you can t avoid going outside during these times wear a high-quality mask such as an N95. Another great tip is to keep the dirty air outside when you re indoors. Use an air conditioner with an effective filtration system rather than opening a window to stay cooler. Stay aware of how things such as candles cigarettes household cleaners and cooking techniques can reduce indoor air quality too. The main thing to remember is that you can t prevent all air pollution exposures. The next best thing is to lessen their effects through measures within your control. That s a proactive way to safeguard your long-term health.

By Chris Sherwood Your heart is the center of your cardiovascular system and it is vitally responsible for just about everything that gives your body life   ranging from the transportation of oxygen to the success of your immune system. However the foods you eat and the amount of activity you choose to take part in can dramatically affect the overall health of your heart and the many other tissues that make up your cardiovascular system. Blood Pressure Your blood pressure is one area of heart health that needs to be regularly checked and regulated. High blood pressure or hypertension can be affected by your overall weight especially once you reach a body mass index score of 30 or higher. This score is classified as obese. Excess fat increases the work your heart has to perform to pump blood throughout your body. The harder your heart works the more pressure is placed on the walls of your arteries which can increase your risk for blood vessel damage. Lowering your body weight by even as little as 5 to 10 percent can lower your blood pressure and increase your heart health. Cholesterol Levels Controlling your cholesterol also plays an important role in heart health; it decreases your risks for heart disease heart attack and stroke. The two main kinds of cholesterol are low-density lipoprotein   LDL or the  bad  cholesterol   and high-density lipoprotein   HDL or the  good  cholesterol. The LDL cholesterol is found in foods high in saturated fat especially animal proteins. When consumed in high levels LDL cholesterol can build up in the bloodstream and calcify into hard plaque. This plaque makes it difficult for blood to circulate through the affected arteries increasing your risk for cardiovascular damage. Circulation Taking care of your heart also affects your circulation. Good circulation is needed to transport oxygen and nutrients to the many different cells in your body. Without proper circulation tissues begin to die which can result in amputations or even death depending on what tissues are not getting enough oxygen. High blood pressure cholesterol plaque and other heart diseases can all affect your body s ability to transport blood efficiently throughout your body. Ways to Keep Your Heart Healthy To keep your heart healthy your body needs adequate amounts of exercise accompanied by a heart-healthy diet. Get at least 30 minutes of exercise five days a week. A heart-healthy diet consists of the majority of your calories coming from vegetables fruits and high-fiber foods like legumes and whole grains. These foods are accompanied in moderation by lean proteins especially fish as well as low-fat dairy products nuts and seeds. Wellbeing How To Quit Your Bad Habits ",Health and Fitness

Here are a few things you should know: Caloric Deficit   if your goal is to lose weight you simply need to maintain a caloric deficit to achieve your goal in time. Many fad diets try to persuade people to eat certain foods to lose fat but research repeatedly shows that a caloric deficit of roughly 500 calories is the most efficient way to lose weight. Variation   maintaining a caloric deficit is important for weight management but healthy living should go beyond weight management. To support a healthy active lifestyle you should eat a varied diet as variation reduces your chances of becoming diabetic improves your mood and can increase your cognitive abilities.

Habit Forming Tips Understanding the importance of diet and exercise is one thing   following through and building a healthy routine is another. But feeling guilty about your bad habits does not work. Guilt will only make you less likely to follow a healthy lifestyle. Instead you need to build a routine that forces you to form healthy habits. Pets There are few things better for building a better routine than adopting a new pet. Pets like dogs need to be walked every day and require you to take regular breaks from work to feed them and let them outside. They also get you up from your desk and require you to walk miles every morning before you even have your first cup of coffee. Owning a pet also helps you stay mentally healthy. The companionship of a pet keeps you stimulated and this can decrease your blood pressure lower cholesterol levels and help you manage conditions like depression. Just make sure to insure your pet as the financial burden of vet bills and medical costs will put extra strain on you and wreak havoc on the healthy habits you have previously formed.

Balance Your Diet   You can enjoy cake or alcohol on the weekend but you should find a balance. If you know you ll be eating big in the evening opt for low-calorie breakfast and lunch options to ensure you get the nutrients you need before you place your evening order. Conclusion Building a healthy routine is all about planning and preparation. You can meal prep before the week starts to ensure you get all the nutrients you need. You should also reach out to friends who will help you form a strong exercise habit. If socializing isn t your thing go outside more often or build a home gym that will give you the solitude you need to achieve your healthy living goals.

You likely spend most of your time at home and so it makes perfect sense that this space influences your health. Even small aspects of your living space can impact your mental or physical wellness. Few people want to be uncomfortable and stressed in their homes but many don t know where the stressors originate from. Fortunately you ll discover a few household factors that determine whether your place is a comfort zone or a source of stress. Here are 10 ways your living space affects your health. 1. Screen Use You love to kick back with your TV or phone after a long day. It helps you unwind but it also messes with your vision and brain chemistry. Staring at screens for too long can affect your sight over time and turn the world into a faraway blur. The blue light these screens emit mimics daylight and tells your body to stay awake even when it s bedtime causing you to lose precious sleeping hours. 2. Bedsheets and Mattress If you get sufficient sleep every night it means you spend at least eight hours a day on your sheets. Your bed becomes a breeding ground for dust mites bacteria and other creepy-crawlies. And don t forget the dead skin cells   your once-comfortable bed quickly turns into a gross mishmash of organisms. You can combat this though by washing your bedding every week. Your mattress also picks up these yucky things   clean it alongside your linens. Washing your sheets won t accomplish much if you put them on a dirty bed. 3. Colour Choices Your home s colours are surprisingly influential to your moods even if you don t realise it. Red inspires anger orange and yellow encourage hunger and blue creates comfort. Painting your bedroom blazing red may not help you have sweet dreams at night and a yellowish-green kitchen could make you feel more sick than hungry. Be mindful of the hues you select for your home   what messages do you want to convey? 4. Greenery Pops of greenery are fun attractive and great for your health. Plants improve indoor air quality by filtering out polluted air and releasing oxygen. They also help reduce stress and depression make you feel calmer and improve productivity. Add more greenery to your home with indoor plants or go extravagant by installing a green roof. Green roofing can last up to three times longer than conventional materials which lets you enjoy a long-lasting and beautiful investment. 5. Ventilation Do you have room to breathe or do you always feel stuffy? Adequate ventilation cleans your air and regulates household temperatures. A humid home encourages mould which brings an entirely new set of health problems. Unclean air exacerbates allergies and respiratory issues which can grow worse if no one treats the source. Consider a whole-home air purifier system to keep the atmosphere fresh and free of allergens. 6. Lighting Fluorescent lighting can cause migraines create problems like eye strain and encourage insomnia. Human eyes prefer natural light but working indoors   and past sunset   forces us to use artificial solutions. Pull the curtains back and illuminate your home with sunlight. The sunny rays supply you with vitamin D which boosts your mood and combats the effects of fluorescent or incandescent lighting. 7. Personal Decor Your decor influences your emotions much like your colour choices. A bare space with little to look at feels impersonal and cold which can make you uncomfortable or depressed. Personal touches allow you to claim a space as yours and make it a warm place to live. 8. Faucets and Water Your taps will collect mineral deposits if you don t clean them especially if you have hard water. These deposits aren t harmful but they can make your water taste unpleasantly different. You don t have to worry much about water safety if you use public groundwater sources but if yours comes from a private well test it regularly for contaminants. 9. Cleaning Products Most people use chemicals to clean their houses but these come with disadvantages. Lingering fumes can irritate your lungs and give you headaches. Spilling chemicals on yourself may aggravate your skin or cause an allergic reaction. Swap some of your cleaners for natural-ingredient brands or make homemade solutions. 10. Overall Cleanliness A cluttered home is hard to live in. You may feel crowded and stressed from the disarray and your confidence may drop due to the state of your house. Deep-clean your place often or hire a cleaning service if possible. A frequently cluttered space can be a sign of depression so don t hesitate to reach out for help if necessary. Improving Your Home For Better Health Knowing how your home affects your wellness enables you to make better decisions when organising your space. You don t have to make drastic improvements overnight but gradually changing things can bring positivity into your life. Your place reflects your thoughts feelings and beliefs   turn it into a welcoming abode. ",Health and Fitness
When you hear cannabis your mind instantly goes to marijuana drugs addiction and destruction. However in the past few decades science has proven that there are little to no dangers to the consumption of cannabis; rather it alleviates the symptoms of or helps with many conditions. Cannabis in its natural form has many different components of which the two most important ones are Cannabidiol (CBD) and Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). While the former is used for medicinal purposes and has multiple health benefits the latter is mainly responsible for the high and addiction that comes with smoking cannabis. Therefore scientists have found a way to separate these components and extract CBD alone for use in medicines food oils and other products so we can take advantage of the benefits. If you ve been prescribed or recommended CBD and are wondering what the health benefits are this article is for you! Read on to find out about 8 health benefits of CBD and which CBD products. Finding Authentic CBD Products Since CBD is a fairly expensive extract many companies use knock-off products that they claim to be real CBD. Using such products will generally do you more harm than good. Therefore it is essential to buy authentic premium CBD products. To check the authenticity of a CBD product check the list of ingredients to see if it specifically mentions CBD or Hemp Extract. Anything else such as hemp seeds or hempseed oil means that the product does not actually contain CBD. Naturally you can imagine that finding an authentic CBD product is bound to be difficult as you may have to visit multiple CBD dispensaries. However finding a reliable brand or store to buy CBD products is not easy especially if you live in a state like Tennessee where the possession purchase and use of Cannabis products is conditional. An easier alternative is to just order your CBD products online from a verified store such as Smoky Mountain Organics the premium Pigeon Forge hemp store. This way you can save yourself the trouble and get authentic CBD products that meet the legal requirements right at your doorstep! Health Benefits Of CBD Scientific research has found that there are multiple health benefits of CBD. From relief from minor aches to serious issues such as alleviating symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) CBD has turned out to be no less than a magic elixir. Let us look at some of the common health benefits of using CBD! 1. Lowering Anxiety People struggling with mental health have often turned to recreational drugs for relief cannabis being a common choice. It was thought that with their brains feeding off the high people with mental disorders such as anxiety and depression could find a temporary escape. However it has now been established that the THC high present in cannabis is actually anxiety-inducing and it is actually CBD that helps manage mental health disorders. 2. Helping With Insomnia Patients with chronic insomnia have reported a great difference in sleep after using CBD. CBD can help insomniacs finally get a good night s sleep by alleviating the symptoms of insomnia like calming the nervous system and reducing anxiety. However these effects have only been seen after consuming moderate to high doses of CBD. Additionally it has also been suggested that CBD can help alleviate symptoms other sleep disorders such as sleep apnea restless leg syndrome and even PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder). 3. Pain Relief One of the most rudimentary health benefits of CBD is pain relief. You can use CBD as an alternative to your paracetamol or ibuprofen and avoid the negative effects of using too much allopathic medicine. A rub of CBD oil on your forehead can instantly eliminate your headache. However CBD technically has the potential to cure chronic pains and body aches including neuropathic pain which is extremely hard to treat. 4. Lower Blood Pressure Another fantastic health benefit of using CBD is helping reduce blood pressure. Hypertension also known as the  silent killer  is one of the most common diseases in the world today and big pharma makes billions if not trillions off of blood pressure medication each year. However research shows that a single dose of CBD can help reduce blood pressure making it a great alternative to traditional hypertension medication. 5. Diabetes Prevention Today over 500 million adults suffer from Diabetes Mellitus and this number is steadily increasing every single day. With the deteriorating quality of food unhealthy habits and inactive lifestyles diabetes is a serious issue facing the world today.

Strong Bones Bone health is essential for people of all ages as weak bones lead to several serious health issues such as arthritis osteoporosis etc. Especially women over the age of 50 are at grave risk of bone issues. A major reason for weak bones is an enzyme produced naturally in the body which obstructs the bone-regeneration and building process. However research has shown that CBD helps improve bone health by directly blocking this enzyme. 7. Healthy Skin Another benefit that makes CBD a miracle extract is its effect on reducing skin inflammation such as acne psoriasis and dermatitis. There are two major ways CBD improves your skin s health. CBD produces an anti-aging effect by blocking the sebaceous glands from working properly and complementing the endocannabinoid system of the skin. Hence with regular use of CBD you can alleviate many skin conditions that can help you achieve that smooth glowing skin of your dreams. 8. Preventing Relapse Addiction today is a fairly common affliction. People are addicted to drugs alcohol nicotine food etc. and all of them are bad for their health. A great benefit of CBD usage is that it helps prevent relapse. With its anxiety-relieving effects CBD helps alleviate cravings brought on by stress and depression. In this way CBD helps people stay sober and healthy in the long run. Final Words CBD has many other health benefits and even more when consumed in its true form as Cannabis. However due to the negative side effects of THC CBD is the better option. CBD has a lot of potential in the medicinal market as it has shown remarkable results in alleviating symptoms of and helping with the treatment of everyday health issues as well as diseases such as epilepsy and MS. Scientists have even suggested that in the future CBD may be able to manage effects of Alzheimer s and Dementia. Food Apple Cider Vinegar: The Magic Potion ",Health and Fitness
Type 2 diabetes is becoming more and more common among people of all ages. A lot of the time this is due to people not knowing how to spot the signs of the disease or people not taking steps to prevent it. This guide by us at Freestyle Libre 2 will not only help you spot the early warning signs of Type 2 diabetes but will also give you some tips on lowering your chances of ever getting it. Early Signs Of Type 2 Diabetes Several early warning signs for Type 2 can be associated with other problems but when experienced together it is often a sign that you are developing the disease. Frequent Urination When too much sugar is in your system your kidneys begin to work harder to filter it all out; this is done through urination. If you find yourself going to the bathroom more regularly especially at night this could be something you need to check. Increased Thirst This is self-explanatory as it is tied in with the point above but it is still important to pay attention to both. Increased thirst would be due to excessive urination and can often lead to dehydration or prolonged thirst no matter how much you drink. Increased Hunger Part of eating and digesting is the body s need to break down food and get the glucose into the bloodstream. If you have diabetes the body can t perform this task effectively leaving you hungry often even a short while after eating. Fatigue Due to the lack of glucose intake described above those with diabetes will often feel tired even if they have had a long and peaceful night s sleep. The body isn t getting enough energy (glucose) in its cells and it will tire quickly and easily. Blurry Vision Excess sugar in your blood can strain your veins and blood vessels especially in and around your eyes; this can lead to blurred vision in one or both eyes. Excess sugar can also cause your eye lens to swell leading to blurred vision. The biggest danger here is that if this problem goes untreated for long enough it can lead to permanent damage and even loss of sight. Slow Healing The damage to the blood nerves and vessels caused by excess sugar can also make it difficult for your body to heal wounds. Those with diabetes often have much longer healing times even from minor cuts or scrapes. Tingling Or Numbness Tingling or numbness in the hands or feet is one of the most common early warning signs. The blood vessel damage described above will affect your circulation; therefore the  pins and needles  sensations will become more common. Patches Of Darker Skin If you begin to develop patches of darker skin that have a velvety feeling in your armpits groin or around your neck this is often a sign of diabetes too. Ways To Prevent Type 2 Diabetes While there is no cure for diabetes there are multiple ways to prevent it. Prevention is crucial for those who have diabetes in their family or those that have a preexisting condition that can be exacerbated by diabetes. Maintain A Healthy Weight One of the best and sometimes easiest things is maintaining a healthy weight. There is no need to be super-skinny and starve yourself but it is essential not to binge or overeat. Exercise Exercise can t prevent or cure everything but a healthy and fit body is a body that can regulate itself effectively. Exercise will improve your cardiovascular system lower fat and maintain your weight. You don t have to be in the gym for multiple hours a day every day of the week but you should be getting some form of physical activity at least 4-5 times a week. You don t have to bench press twice your body weight or run ten miles; the goal is to get your heart and body to move for a sustained period of time. Healthy Eating Eating healthily is probably the best thing you can do to prevent diabetes. The food we eat has a massive impact on how our body performs and the saying  you are what you eat  has been used for ages for a reason. Once again there is no need to be extreme with your diet as it is more about not eating certain things than it is about eating other foods. Limit or eliminate food and drinks that are high in sugar saturated fats or are processed. Include lots of fresh fruit and vegetables in your diet and when thirsty opt for water instead of soda or alcohol. Preventing diabetes can be a struggle for some but it is something that more people need to be paying attention to. There are many cases where people only find out they have it when it is too late but starting prevention now will only lower your chances of getting it more and more as time goes by.
