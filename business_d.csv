Investors are underrating the potential for an economic mishap JPMorgan chief Jamie Dimon said doubling down on similar warnings hes made in recent days. Speaking with reporters on Friday in a call the prominent CEO characterized markets as too happy saying that the chance of bad outcomes is higher than people think.For now the economy appears to be doing fine Dimon acknowledged citing support from excess savings low unemployment and the record-setting stock market. But difficulties are starting to emerge among lower-income earners and the bank has noted fractures in subprime auto loans he said. According to Quartz he pushed back on speculation over figures such as interest rates and yields citing these estimates to often be wrong.You have to ask the question What if other things happen like higher rates or a modest recession etc. and then all these numbers change? he said. I just dont think any of us should be surprised if and when that happens.These comments came the same day as JPMorgans estimate-beating first-quarter earnings report with the Wall Street giant posting a 9% year-over-year revenue gain of $41.9 billion. Earnings per share reached $4.44 surpassing a consensus estimate of $4.14 from AlphaSense.In a related press release Dimon celebrated the banks strong quarterly performance but issued warnings about significant uncertain forces including geopolitical tensions inflationary pressures and the unknown effects of large-scale quantitative tightening.Both the call and press release echoed cautious sentiment in a letter to shareholders Dimon released just four days prior in it he warned the world was entering its most treacherous era since World War II and disagreed with markets about the odds of a US soft landing.Jeremy Barnum the CFO of JPMorgan echoed Dimons views during his own call with reporters on FridayThe economic geopolitical and regulatory uncertainties that weve been talking about for some time remain prominent he said quoted by Quartz. And we are focused on being prepared to navigate those challenges as well as any others that may come our way.,Business and Finance
MOSCOW/LONDON Russian oil and products have become trapped at sea on four tankers after the United States hit the vessels with fresh Iran-related sanctions LSEG data showed on Friday. The development shows how Moscow and Tehran have boosted cooperation in the face of rising Western sanctions and how the West is trying to untangle a complex web of firms to reduce the loopholes and revenue to both countries. On April 4 the United States imposed new Iran-related sanctions against a shipping firm Oceanlink Maritime DMCC and its vessels citing its role in shipping commodities on behalf of the Iranian military. The United States is using financial sanctions to isolate Iran and disrupt its ability to fund its proxy groups and support Russia s war in Ukraine the Treasury Department said. The list of vessels under sanctions includes three fuel tankers which loaded oil products in February-March and a crude oil tanker that loaded Russian oil early in April. A very large crude carrier (VLCC) Anthea loaded some 200000 metric tons of Russian Urals crude off the Laconian Gulf near Greece through separate ship to ship transfers (STS) with two vessels late in March and is currently anchored in the Suez Canal with oil onboard LSEG data showed. The vessel has remained at anchor in the Suez Canal since early April according to LSEG data. Another vessel under sanctions - Elsa took fuel oil on board in March via a ship-to-ship transfer near the Greek port of Kalamata LSEG data shows. The fuel oil some 100000 metric tons was supplied to Kalamata from Russia s St. Petersburg and Ust-Luga ports in March according to the data. Claire Jungman chief of staff at US advocacy group United Against Nuclear Iran which tracks Iran-related tanker traffic via satellite data confirmed movements of both vessels adding that since 2021 Elsa has transported over 9 million barrels of Iranian crude or fuel oil to the UAE Singapore and China. Elsa has been at anchor off Singapore since early April according to LSEG data. The other vessel Hebe was loaded with the 100000 tons of fuel oil at the Russian Baltic ports St Petersburg and Ust-Luga. The tanker is heading towards the Suez Canal but the final destination is unclear yet. The vessel Baxter loaded with naphtha at the Black Sea port of Novorossiisk was destined for India according to LSEG data. The tanker has been drifting in the Arabian Sea since April 5 shipping data shows.The recent actions against ships tied to Iran s military spotlight a serious shift some of these ships previously involved in dodging sanctions for Iran have started dealings with RussiaJungman said.These ships face major hurdles because of secondary sanctions. Ports worldwide are likely to deny them entry to avoid the repercussions of breaking these sanctions themselves ...Jungman added. Russian oil suppliers are unlikely to use these vessels or any provided by the shipping firm under sanctions now potentially tightening the already thin tonnage involved in Russian oil trades a source in Russian oil market said. Reuters was not able to contact Oceanlink Maritime DMCC.,Business and Finance
WASHINGTON Inflation is easing faster than expected but has not been fully defeated International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva said on Thursday urging central bankers to carefully calibrate their decisions on cutting interest rates to incoming data.Georgieva said headline inflation for advanced economies was 2.3% in the final quarter of 2023 down from 9.5% just 18 months ago and the downward trend was expected to continue in 2024.That would create the conditions for central banks in major advanced economies to begin cutting rates in the second half of the year although the pace and timing would vary she told an event hosted by the Atlantic Council think tank.IMF mission to determine size duration of new loan On this final stretch it is doubly important that central banks uphold their independenceGeorgieva said urging policymakers to resist calls for early rate cuts when necessary. Premature easing could see new inflation surprises that may even necessitate a further bout of monetary tightening. On the other side delaying too long could pour cold water on economic activityshe said.Georgieva said next week s World Economic Outlook would show that global growth is marginally stronger given robust activity in the United States and in many emerging market economies but gave no specific new forecasts.She said the global economy s resilience was being helped by strong labor markets and an expanding labor force strong household consumption and an easing of supply chain issues but said there were stillplenty of things to worry about. Shocks in G20 emerging economies hit rich-world growth IMF The global environment has become more challenging. Geopolitical tensions increase the risks of fragmentation and as we learned over the past few years we operate in a world in which we must expect the unexpectedGeorgieva told an event hosted by the Atlantic Council think tank.She said global activity was weak by historical standards and prospects for growth had been slowing since the global financial crisis of 2008-2009. The global output loss since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 was $3.3 trillion disproportionately hitting the most vulnerable countries.Georgieva said the U.S. had seen the strongest rebound among advanced economies helped by rising productivity growth. Euro area activity was recovering more gradually given the lingering impact of high energy prices and weaker productivity growth.Among emerging market economies countries like Indonesia and India were faring better but low-income countries had seen the most severe scarring.World Bank may approve $150m for two projects todayGiven a significant and broad-based slowdown in productivity growth the IMF s five-year outlook for global growth was just above 3% well below its historical average of 3.8% she said. Without a course correction we are heading forthe Tepid Twenties- a sluggish and disappointing decadeGeorgieva said urging continued vigilance to restore price stability rebuild fiscal buffers and jumpstart growth.She said foundational reforms such as strengthening governance cutting red tape increasing female labor market participation and improving access to capital could lift output by 8% in four years she said.Even more was possible with policies to encourage economic transformation speeding up the green and digital transition which could offer huge opportunities for investment jobs and growth she said.Artificial intelligence offered huge potential benefits but also risks with a recent IMF study showing that AI could affect up to 40% of jobs across the world and 60% in advanced economies Georgieva said.,Business and Finance
JPMorgan Chase s profit rose 6% in the first quarter although its shares dropped after the bank s forecast for its income from interest payments came in below analystsexpectations.High borrowing costs have helped lenders boost net interest income (NII) or the difference between what banks earn on loans and pay out for deposits.However banks are factoring in the possibility of cuts in interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve later this year.JPMorgan the biggest U.S. bank by assets also added billions of dollars of loans to its balance sheet after acquiring failed First Republic Bank in May last year fueling its interest income further.CEO Jamie Dimon however stuck to his cautious tone despite growing optimism in the last several months about a soft landing for the economy. Many economic indicators continue to be favorable. However looking ahead we remain alert to a number of significant uncertain forceshe said in a statement.JPMorgan bets on new wealth planning tool to draw investmentsThose includeunsettlingglobal conflicts persistent inflationary pressure and quantitative tightening Dimon said.The bank expects full-year NII excluding trading of $89 billion depending on market fluctuations. That is up from a previous estimate of $88 billion but lower than the $90.68 billion analysts had expected according to LSEG.Shares of the bank fell 3.5% in trading before the bell. The bank s executives have warned for months that its surging NII was not sustainable.Despite the fall in shares analysts believe that this was yet anothersolidquarter from JPMorgan. The bank s financials looked very encouragingsaid Octavio Marenzi CEO of management consultancy firm Opimas adding that the only negative was the increase in non-interest expenses.The lender also earmarked $725 million to replenish a government deposit insurance fund less than the $3 billion it set aside at the end of last year.JPMorgan was among the banking giants that made up the bulk of contributions to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp fund which was drained when three regional lenders failed last year.That drove the bank s expense forecast to $91 billion compared with the $90 billion it had estimated earlier.In contrast to peers that are trimming staff JPMorgan added about 2000 employees to its workforce of 311921. That is 5% higher than a year earlier.Profit was $13.42 billion or $4.44 per share for the three months ended March 31 compared with $12.62 billion or $4.10 per share a year earlier. Consumers remain financially healthy supported by a resilient labor marketChief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum said.JPMorgan appoints Rita Chan Alan Ho as China co-senior country officersLoans jumped 16% to $1.31 trillion while NII rose 11% to $23.2 billion. Excluding the impact of First Republic NII was still 5% higher than last year.JPMorgan set aside $1.88 billion as provisions for credit losses compared with $2.28 billion last year.Trading revenue at the bank fell 5% to $8 billion with revenue from fixed income currency and commodities (FICC) dropping 7% and equities flat.Investment banking revenue gained 27% to $2 billion driven by higher fees earned on debt and stock underwriting. Fees earned advising on mergers and acquisitions (M&A) however fell. We have some momentum in announced M&A which is good to see but there are regulatory headwinds thereBarnum said.Overall revenue rose 9% to $41.93 billion.SuccessionJPMorgan s succession plans have been in focus for months especially after Morgan Stanley and Lazard named new CEOs.Contenders for the top job include Jennifer Piepszak and Troy Rohrbaugh recently appointed co-CEOs of JPMorgan s expanded commercial and investment bank and Marianne Lake CEO of consumer and community banking. We do not have any reason to believe that Dimon will depart in the immediate futuresaid Brian Mulberry client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management. There is a lot of speculation around him being offered some kind of Cabinet position in a new administration but neither candidate nor Dimon have given any indication that the rumor is even remotely plausible right now.,Business and Finance
Wells Fargo s profit fell 7% in the first quarter as it became more costly to pay customers for deposits and demand from borrowers declined the bank reported on Friday.Still adjusted profit of $1.26 per share came ahead of analystsestimates of $1.11 according to LSEG data helped by revenue in corporate and investment banking which gained almost 5%.Shares fell 1.6% in early trading.The bank s net interest income (NII) the difference between what it earns on loans and pays out for deposits fell 8% to $12.23 billion.The bank s income from interest was eroded as it paid more to hold on to deposits from customers who were seeking higher yields while loans declined. It s certainly challenging these days to forecast NII given all of the volatility that we ve seen across a lot of the different data points as well as some of the uncertainty that s out there relative to how our clients are going to behavefinance chief Michael Santomassimo told reporters on a call.The bank reiterated on Friday that its NII could fall 7% to 9% this year. People expected better net interest income and them to guide highersaid Stephen Biggar a banking analyst at Argus Research.Bank of America analyst Ebrahim Poonawala reiterated his buy rating on the stock saying the results and outlook supported aconstructive view. The shifting U.S. interest rate outlook is an important factor that will drive banksfuture profits. U.S. consumer prices increased more than expected in March leading financial markets to anticipate that the Federal Reserve would delay cutting rates until September.Higher rates had boosted lendersearnings as they brought in more money from interest payments but that benefit waned in the first quarter of 2024.The increased interest rate have also made it more costly for banks prompting them to pay more to keep deposits from customers who are seeking higher yields.Tighter monetary policy could also crimp borrower demand and dampen economic activity including Wall Street dealmaking.Wells Fargo also paid $284 million into a Federal Deposit Insurance Corp fund that was drained last year after three regional lenders failed.Average loans fell $20.6 billion or 2% year-over-year driven by declines in most loan categories the bank said.Rivals Citigroup posted lower profit as it spent more on severance payments and set aside money to refill the government deposit insurance fund while JPMorgan Chase forecast 2024 NII below analystsexpectations.Wells Fargo reduced its allowances for credit losses on office loans by $76 million to $2.4 billion in the first quarter.

The bank was not overly concerned about weakness in multi-family buildings and it does not have substantial exposure in rent stabilized properties he added.A surprise fourth-quarter loss at New York Community Bank fueled industry concerns about weakness in commercial real estate that expanded beyond offices into multi-family properties with more than five units.Easing scrutinyCredit card lending was a bright spot while auto lending suffered a sharp 23% fall in the quarter.The bank is operating under a $1.95 trillion asset cap that prevents it from growing until regulators deem it has fixed problems from a fake accounts scandal.The lender still has eight open consent orders after the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) terminated a 2016 punishment in February. We reached an important milestone in the first quarter when the OCC announced the termination of a consent order it issued in 2016 regarding sales practices misconductCEO Charlie Scharf said in a statement. The remaining risk and control work continues to be our top priority and we will not be satisfied until all work is completehe added.Scharf became CEO in 2019 the fourth person to lead Wells Fargo since the scandal first emerged. He has worked to turn the lender around cutting costs and exiting businesses after it racked up billions in lawsuits and regulatory fines.Overall non-interest expenses rose 5% in the quarter partly driven by higher FDIC assessments the bank said.Wells Fargo s stock has climbed about 15.2% so far this year compared with a 10.4% gain in the S&P 500 Banks Index which tracks large banks,Business and Finance

The Supreme Court of Pakistan has dismissedwith no order as to costsappeals against the High Court of Sindh and the Lahore High Court decision regarding the interpretation of Article VI of theConvention between the Government of Pakistan and the Government of the United States of America for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income .As per the apex court judgment a copy of which is available with Business Recorder the basic issue in all these cases was the interpretation of(1) The rate of United States tax on dividends paid by a United States corporation to a Pakistan company- (i) not having a permanent establishment in the United States and (ii) owning shares carrying more than 50 per cent of the voting power in the corporation paying such dividends. Shall not exceed fifteen per cent. (2) (i) Where a United States corporation- has no permanent establishment in Pakistan and (ii) is a public companyand (iii) owns shares carrying more than 50 per cent of the voting power of a company which is a resident of Pakistan and is engaged in an industrial undertaking of the classes specified in section 15-B of the Income Tax Act 1922 (XI of 1922) the rate of Pakistan super tax otherwise pavable with respect to dividends paid by such company to such corporation shall be reduced by 1 anna in the rupee.Double taxation pact with The Netherlands SC turns down SHC s judgement on applicability of Article 7 or Article 12As per the Supreme Court the matter in issue for the Appellants is that the impugned judgment and orders have misinterpreted Article VI of the Convention mainly that the tax is to be reduced by 1 anna in the rupee which is 1/16th of the tax rate which comes to 0.0625% and not 6.25%. So as per their contentions it means that from the given rate of 15% a rebate of 0.0625% has to be subtracted that is 14.0625%. This they argue is the applicable rateread the judgement.The SC said that after examining the given Article as well as the impugned judgment and orders wherein two aspects are very clear. Firstly Article VI applies to the rate of tax and not on the amount of the tax. In this respect the Article is clear that the rebate is given on the rate of tax. The rebate provision reduces the rate of the tax and not the amount of the tax. The reduction in the rebate is / anna in the rupee which expressed in percentage term is 6.25%. This is the figure that has to be subtracted from the applicable rate of tax which at the time was 15%. This in turn means that the tax rate has been reduced to 8.75%. The argument of the Appellants that the reduction in the rate would bring the rate of tax to 14.0625% has been aptly dealt with by the High Court of Sindhit added. Secondly the rebate provision is not linked with the super tax. The Article VI of the Convention merely fixes the rate of the rebate to 1 anna in the rupeeread the judgment.The Supreme Court noted that the basic difference of opinion is the understanding of the calculation as to what the rate of the rebate is resulting in a reduction in the rate of tax.There can be no other interpretation in this respect and whether it is looked at as 1/16th or it is looked at in the form of 1 anna in the rupee while expressed in percentage term the amount comes to 6.25%. Therefore we find no illegality or infirmity in the impugned judgment and ordersread the SC judgment. Under the circumstances these Appeals being devoid of force are dismissed with no order as to costsit added.The development means the Supreme Court of Pakistan has settled the controversy regarding the rebate available against super tax on dividend payable to a US Company by a Pakistani entity.The Double Tax Treaty between Pakistan and the United States of America provides a rebate in the tax rate equal to one anna in a rupee.Tax department interpreted it as a rebate in the amount of tax whereas in fact it is rebate in the rate of tax. One anna in a rupee means 6.25%. So if the rate of tax is 15% then the said rate will be reduced by 6.25 resulting in the applicable rate of 8.75.The tax department interpreted the same as 6.25 of 15% which has been disregarded by the Supreme Court.This case depicts that a relevant clause in the treaty remained under litigation since 1957 when the said treaty was signed. This means that US companies were under litigation for 67 years. It added nothing but confusion and legal charges and waste of time of the courts.,Business and Finance
This years stock rally has more gas in the tank according to a Goldman Sachs strategist. John Flood head of Americas equities sales trading at Goldmans global banking and markets division said in a briefing on Friday that investors fretting over a stock market bubble can relax as he believes the S&P 500 set to soar further for four reasons. First the strategist predicts a late April market surge as historical pattern traditionally see investors take gains ahead of tax season leading to a temporary sell-off before a fresh uptick later in the month. Retail investors tend to sell stocks in order to pay their tax bills meaning we often see the market slip into Tax Day then rally afterwards he said. Second he pointed out that publicly-traded companies remain important buyers of their own stocks. In this case the stock supply squeeze is poised to drive up huge market demand fueling a forthcoming stock rally. The corporate buyback bid remains robust. Were modeling $925 billion of repurchases this year he said citing Goldman Sachs research. Third future confidence stems from money market funds with a massive inflow of $1.6 trillion occurring since 2023. This indicates to Flood that theres still plenty of dry powder out there for investors to deploy into the stock market. Finally Flood notes that the current sentiment isnt screaming all-time bullish just yet as hedge funds have recently seen money flowing out. Peak bullishness tends to be a contrarian indicator that says the next move for stocks is likely down but the market isnt there yet. Hedge funds have been net sellers of stocks and have picked up their shorting activity significantly in recent weeks he said.,Business and Finance
Wednesdays inflation report showed consumer price growth continues to drift higher.The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported price growth accelerated to 3.5% in March from 3.2% in February.Few categories had as big a jump year on year than auto insurance which soared 22% from March 2023 the most significant year-on-year jump in that category since 1976. And over the last few years average auto insurance rates have surged 43%.As of April the national average cost of car insurance is $2314 per year for full coverage and $644 per year for the bare minimum according to Bankrate.That works out to about $193 a month for full coverage and $54 for minimum coverage. A host of factors determine how much insurance companies charge drivers but the cost of nearly all of them seem to be increasing.One major factor is simply the rising cost of modern vehicles themselves. Today a new vehicle costs about $10000 more than it did before the pandemic. Blame supply-chain issues that drove up the cost of vehicle parts increased labor costs and customer demand which has naturally pushed prices upward. The increasing sophistication of the technology in today s vehicles also contributes to rising costs said Robert Passmore department vice president of personal lines at American Property Casualty Insurance Association. Cameras and sensors which are used for various driver-assistance technologies like emergency braking automated parking and blind-spot monitoring require parts that are more expensive to replace. Theyre also subject to higher labor costs Passmore said. More complex and expensive repairs are also taking longer and that shows up as higher vehicle costs Passmore said. And worker shortages have resulted in higher pay for technicians.Meanwhile the higher cost of buying a vehicle has prompted some drivers to hold on to their existing cars for longer. As a vehicle ages the likelihood of breakdowns rises increasing the demand for repair services said Sarah House managing director and senior economist at Wells Fargo. Insurers are trying to recoup very costly claimsHouse said. Other factors are at work too. According to the Insurance Information Institute which represents insurance companies and the insurance industry the severity of claims including the medical and litigation costs that arise in claim disputes are also on the rise. In the years immediately after the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic insurance companies took large losses due in part to an increase in bad driver behaviors. As a result they have pushed state regulators who determine how high rates can go to allow them to charge higher premiums while in some cases threatening to leave states entirely if they dont. According to S&P Global Market Intelligence those companies have been able to win huge rate increases as a result. The bad news is there is no end in sight to the cost pressures. Insurance companies filed for rate increases throughout the end of 2023 and at the start of this year Bankrate analyst Shannon Martin said in an email. Because such rate changes hit auto policies only upon renewal U.S. drivers are just starting to feel the impact Martin said.Car insurance inflation is sticky and while inflation has slowed down and supply chain issues are improving the premium increases we are seeing and will continue to see in 2024 are based on losses carriers experienced over the last few years Martin said. The ultimate goal is for rates in the insurance industry to stabilize but that might not happen until sometime next year.,Business and Finance
Inflation remained elevated once again in March adding another round of price increases to Americans already-strained wallets. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 12-month price growth accelerated from 3.2% in February to 3.5% in March matching consensus forecasts among economists. Excluding food and energy which represent commodities with more volatile prices the so-called core 12-month reading was unchanged in March at 3.8%.Some of the items seeing the largest 12-month leaps in price gains included auto insurance which soared 22.2%; domestic services like home cleaning up 10.9%; baby food and formula up 9.9%; and outpatient hospital services up 8.3%.If there was any relief it was in grocery prices which were up just 1.2% on the year. And prices for new and used vehicles fell. But Greg McBride chief financial analyst at Bankrate put the situation succinctly in an email following Wednesdays release. There is no improvement here we re moving in the wrong directionhe said. On paper the U.S. economy has looked solid. The unemployment rate has now remained below 4% for the longest stretch since the 1960s. Stocks have been at all-time highs. The economy continues to add jobs. But since the start of the pandemic Americans have seen average prices increase more than 20% overall giving people a sense that the cost of many goods and services not to mention housing has surged to unreasonable levels.So what will cause price growth to finally slow down to the Federal Reserves 2% target?Unfortunately it usually takes a major economic crisis for broad categories of prices to reverse. Instead the best that consumers can hope for is that they stop going up so fast. While there are some signs that its happening grocery price increases for instance have finally fallen below 2% after surging during the pandemic economists say its likely to still take some time for inflation to truly subside. Complex economic forces they say continue to keep price growth elevated. A significant worker shortage sparked by the pandemic especially for front-line service employees helped push hourly pay higher. But this resulted in pushing up prices on the consumer side since labor costs represent a significant portion of the overall cost of given goods or service.Meanwhile supply chain disruptions that emerged during the pandemic have yet to fully subside said Sarah House a managing director and senior economist at Wells Fargo. She pointed to automobile prices which have surged more than 20% since the start of the pandemic for new vehicles and more than 30% for used vehicles. While the pace of their price increases has abated difficulties in sourcing auto parts plus the loss of experienced technicians have pushed vehicle prices higher.This in turn has pushed auto insurance rates higher and it turns out that car insurance commands a significant percentage of the overall increase in consumer prices.The services side is where we re continuing to see stronger [price] growthHouse said.That s where we re still getting an elevated degree of inflation from. Americanspay has barely kept up with the price increases. While federal stimulus at the outset of the pandemic helped give people a cash cushion during the worst of it there is an emerging consensus that this same cushion helped drive prices higher by giving people money to spend.On net Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that the effect of inflation has caused Americansaverage hourly pay to rise by just a few cents compared with where it was at the start of the pandemic.The Federal Reserve which is in charge of taming price growth in part by raising interest rates has sought to fight fire with fire. By raising the cost of borrowing money the central bank has tried to reduce demand for goods and services ultimately pushing price growth down. The Fed s interest rate hikes have indeed caused borrowing costs for everything from credit cards to automobiles to homes to climb to levels not seen in years.For many Americans that s meant getting locked out of the housing market not to mention paying credit card rates above 20% and auto loan rates above 8%.But inflation has persisted surprising many economists. At the start of the year the consensus forecast was for economic growth to slow allowing the Fed to start cutting interest rates this spring with a total of three cuts for 2024.But a growing number of analysts now say that at a minimum rate cuts will be delayed. Still others say there won t even be three cuts.Despite all the challenges the risk of a recession that would lead to significant job losses remains low. Yet there are signs that consumer jitters are accelerating. The New York Federal Reserve reported Monday that fears of job losses are climbing and that workers who are already out of a job say getting hired is now more difficult than it was prior to the pandemic. While about one-quarter of Americans report their household financial situation to be better than a year ago about one-third report being worse off. It all adds up to a precarious situation. In a speech last week Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell called the economic outlook still quite uncertain.The job of sustainably restoring 2% inflation is not yet done he said.,Business and Finance
Oil prices shot up on Friday amid reports Israel is gearing up for an attack by Iran as early as this weekend an event that would mark the most significant escalation in Middle East tensions since last Octobers Israel-Hamas conflict.West Texas Intermediate crude oil rose as much as 2% before paring some gains. WTI hovered around $85.88 at 100 p.m. ET. Brent surged past $90 a barrel hitting $91.98. The sudden spike in crude prices came after reports that Israel was bracing for a potential direct attack from Iran on southern or northern territory as soon as Friday or Saturday though sources close to Iranian leaders told The Wall Street Journal that no final decision had been reached yet.Oil has been on the rise in recent weeks as economic activity in the US remains high and conflict simmers in the Middle East with some commentators eyeing a rapid ascent to $100 a barrel if war spills out into the greater region. If push comes to shove between Israel and Iran $100 or more is likely Market veteran Ed Yardeni commented on Friday. Irans potential method of attack on Israel is uncertain though Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to respond directly to any aggression.Earlier this week US intelligence reports indicated an imminent threat of an attack on Israeli assets by Iran or its proxies which was confirmed by a knowledgeable US official specifying that the potential strike could target possibly on Israeli soil rather than Israeli interests elsewhere.The killing of seven Iranian military personnel by an Israeli airstrike on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria this week signaled a notable intensification of hostilities. Irans Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has pledged to retaliate against Israel.Broader financial markets are on edge over the possibility that the conflict intensifies. Stocks were down on Friday with the S&P 500 shedding 1.5% by midday and the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbling nearly 500 points. The financial markets are bracing for this calamitous scenario. The S&P 500 has had a nearly vertical ascent of 27.6% from 4117.37 on October 27 2023 to 5254.35 on March 29. That might be it for a while especially if push does come to shove between Israel and Iran Yardeni wrote. For now we are sticking with our yearend target of 5400 but we cant rule out a test of the 200-dma under the circumstances.The unease pushed up the price of safe-haven assets with gold reaching another record high Friday and US government bond yields tumbling. ,Business and Finance
Tesla stock wont reverse its massive sell-off until it commits to its original plans to develop a low-cost Model 2 vehicle according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.Tesla stock is down 30% year-to-date and is down 58% since its record high as concerns grow about weakening demand for its electric vehicles. The companys first-quarter deliveries came in well below expectations and one analyst estimates that the company has unsold inventory of about 150000 vehicles.A recent report from Reuters said that Tesla is ditching plans for a low-cost Model 2 and will instead focus on the development of its Robotaxi platform stoking concerns among Tesla bulls including Ives.If robotaxis is viewed as the magic model to replace Model 2 we would view this as a debacle negative for the Tesla story. It would be a risky gamble if Tesla moved away from the Model 2 and went straight to robotaxis Ives said in a Friday note.For his part Tesla CEO Elon Musk denied the Reuters report though the company did announce an August 8 event to talk about its robotaxi developments.Ives concerns on the potential pivot away from a Model 2 is predicated on his estimate that about 60% of Teslas future growth will from from a low-cost vehicle that costs around $25000. Meanwhile Ives doesnt expect a fully autonomous robotaxi to be on the road until 2030 compared to a Model 2 that Ives estimates could arrive by 2026. Robotaxi is not the near-term answer to fill this growth gap while Model 2 is and this dynamic must be conveyed to the Street on the conference call April 23 Ives said.Ultimately the potential pivot away from a Model 2 which has long been part of Teslas Master Plan would be just another concern for the bulls as the company deals with intense competition from China auto manufacturers and hybrid cars as well as murmurs of Musks AI efforts being separate from Tesla.With this quarter and unlike other times Street criticism is warranted as growth has been sluggish and margins showing compression with China a horror show and competition increasing from all angles Ives said. For Musk this is a fork in the road time to get Tesla through this turbulent period otherwise dark days could be ahead.Wedbush reiterated its Outperform rating and $300 price target representing potential upside of 73% from current levels. ,Business and Finance
Wall Street is once again underestimating the earnings potential of Apple and that should lead to significant upside for the stock price going forward according to a Thursday note from Bank of America.Its been a tough go of it for Apple so far this year with the stock down 9% as investors grow increasingly concerned about where future growth will come from. But Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan said Apple has plenty of levers to pull when it comes to boosting its profits above expectations.We see upside from vertical integration and mix on the product side that could account for over 100bps of GM upside Mohan said. And on the services side Mohan sees another 100 basis points of potential growth margin upside driven by lower cost delivery from AAPL-based datacenters and silicon.In other words Apples use of in-house designed chips and reducing its reliance on public cloud providers should drive significant cost savings. Altogether those estimates suggest that Apple could considerably surprise Wall Street to the upside where it matters most profit growth. A similar scenario played out in 2018 according to the bank when Wall Street estimated Apples profit margins would hit 39% in 2023. It turned out Apples profit margins were materially higher coming in at 44% in 2023. In our opinion the Street continues to underestimate the long-term gross margin potential for Apple across both products and Services yet again where we see about 180bps of Product gross margin upside and about 150bps of Services margins upside over the next few years Mohan said.Part of the Services upside could come from Apples highly anticipated introduction of an iPhone with Generative AI capabilities according to Mohan while profit upside on the product side could come from higher iPhone prices as consumers continue to favor the more expensive Pro iPhone models.Bank of America reiterated its Buy rating and $225 price target in a note on Thursday representing potential upside of 28% from Thursdays close.,Business and Finance
